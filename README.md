## Technologies used

### NVM

Node Version Manager (nvm) is a tool that allows you to manage multiple versions of Node.js on the same machine. Each version runs in its own isolated environment, so you can safely switch versions without affecting the whole system.

### NPM

npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

### SASS (SCSS)

Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.

### Webpack

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

### JavaScript

### Redux

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.

### Service Worker

A service worker is a script that your browser runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Today, they already include features like push notifications and background sync. In the future, service workers might support other things like periodic sync or geofencing. The core feature discussed in this tutorial is the ability to intercept and handle network requests, including programmatically managing a cache of responses.

### Sentry

Sentry is an open-source error tracking platform that provides complete app logic, deep context, and visibility across the entire stack in real time. For the first time, developers can fix bugs at every stage of the product lifecycle, well before users ever encounter a problem.

### Cypress

Cypress is free, open source, and locally installed front end testing tool. It can be used by developers or QA engineers, who build web applications using JavaScript framework. One can do unit testing, integration testing and end to end testing by writing test case using Cypress. Using cypress, one can test anything that can run in browser.
